The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H5 (4.2.24).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, CalDAV support, shared calendars, remote calendars,
invitation management (iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource
management, alarms, recurring events, and a sophisticated day/week view which
handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping events. For more information on
Kronolith, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith.

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see

The major changes compared to Kronolith version H5 (4.2.23) are:
    * Prevent fatal error if calendar not found during DAV sync.
    * Fix regression in exporting single tags to iCalendar CATEGORIES.
    * Fix SCHEDULE-AGENT setting if there is only one attendee.
    * Fix displaying event start time in calendar feed if using 12-hours time format.
