The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H5 (4.2.15).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features include Ajax and
mobile interfaces, CalDAV support, shared calendars, remote calendars,
invitation management (iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource
management, alarms, recurring events, and a sophisticated day/week view which
handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping events. For more information on
Kronolith, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith.

For upgrading instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith/docs/UPGRADING

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/kronolith/docs/INSTALL

The major changes compared to Kronolith version H5 (4.2.14) are:
   * Handle gracefully if the base event of an imported recurrence exception
     is no longer recurring.
   * Fix typo preventing deletion of events from dynamic view.
